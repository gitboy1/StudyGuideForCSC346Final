### 1. What is Groovy? 
Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform, is compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java's. Groovy supports closures, multiline strings, and expressions embedded in strings. Much of the Groovy's power lies in its AST transformations, triggered through annotations.
### 2. What is the JDK? 
### 3. Does Groovy use the same JDK as Java? 
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development
### 4. How are primitives like integers represented in Groovy? They are represented as objects.
### 5. How are arrays represented in Groovy? 
def testArray = new String[3]
testArray[0] = "A"
testArray[1] = "B"
testArray[2] = "C"
### 6. Be able to code a for loop that iterates an array?

## jsoup and scraping web pages 
### 1. What is scraping? 
### 2. Is scraping ethical? 
### 3. One way to scrape files is to read the page and just use regular expressions to find the parts you are interested in. Why is Jsoup likely to be a better solution in most cases?

### 7. What are attributes? 
### 8. Can you represent arrays in XML? 
* If you had an array, how would you simulate it? 
### 9. Can you use jsoup with XML? 
* Should you? 
### 10. What is StAX? 
### 11. Coding with StAX. 
* You will probably want source code, but it is important that you understand what is going on in the sourcecode. 
* be able to read and extract inner text 
* be able to extract attributes 
* What is the general procedure for creating an XML document in StAX? 
* How do you go about adding elements and attributes in StAX?
